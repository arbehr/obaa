/**
 *
 * Underlying organizational structure of this learning object.
 *
 * atomic: an object that is indivisible (in this context). collection: a set of
 * objects with no specified relationship between them. networked: a set of
 * objects with relationships that are unspecified. hierarchical: a set of
 * objects whose relationships can be represented by a tree structure. linear: a
 * set of objects that are fully ordered. Example: A set of objects that are
 * connected by "previous" and "next" relationships
 *
 * NOTE:A learning object with Structure="atomic" will typically have
 * General.AggregationLevel=1. A learning object with
 * Structure="collection", "linear", "hierarchical" or "networked" will
 * typically have General.AggregationLevel=2, 3 or 4.
