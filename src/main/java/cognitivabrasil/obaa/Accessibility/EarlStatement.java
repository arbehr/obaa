 * Some resources can only be controlled using a mouse or mouse equivalent. This
 * means users who do not have a mouse or cannot control a mouse cannot control
 * such resources. If all of the functions controlled by the mouse can also be
 * controlled using keyboard commands, users will have access to the same
 * functionality using a keyboard or any number of other keyboard-emulating
 * devices (e.g., scanning systems, coding systems, enlarged keyboards, etc.).
 * Some interfaces require many sequential actions to navigate to a desired
 * control, such as a button. This can be difficult for some users. Interfaces
 * that allow reconfiguration of the actions required to access specific
 * controls, buttons, links or input fields enable the optimization of the
 * control method. Control flexibility describes how the resource supports a
 * choice of methods of controlling the resource functions. It is anticipated
 * that this will be determined using accessibility-checking tools.
