 *
 * Predominant mode of learning supported by this learning object.
 *
 * "Active" learning (e.g., learning by doing) is supported by content that
 * directly induces productive action by the learner. An active learning object
 * prompts the learner for semantically meaningful input or for some other kind
 * of productive action or decision, not necessarily performed within the
 * learning object's framework. Active documents include simulations,
 * questionnaires, and exercises.
 *
 * "Expositive" learning (e.g., passive learning) occurs when the learner's job
 * mainly consists of absorbing the content exposed to him (generally through
 * text, images or sound). An expositive learning object displays information
 * but does not prompt the learner for any semantically meaningful input.
 * Expositive documents include essays, video clips, all kinds of graphical
 * material, and hypertext documents. When a learning object blends the active
 * and expositive interactivity types, then its interactivity type is "mixed".
 *
 * NOTE:--Activating links to navigate in hypertext documents is not considered
 * to be a productive action.
 *
 * Value Space: active, expositive or mixed
 *
 * Example: active documents (with learner's action): - simulation (manipulates,
 * controls or enters data or parameters); - questionnaire (chooses or writes
 * answers); - exercise (finds solution); - problem statement (writes solution).
 *
 * expositive documents (with learner's action): - hypertext document (reads,
 * navigates); - video (views, rewinds, starts, stops); - graphical material
 * (views); - audio material (listens, rewinds, starts, stops).
 *
 * mixed document: - hypermedia document with embedded simulation applet.
